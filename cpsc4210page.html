        <h1>CPSC 4210: Software Testing and Debugging (5 credit class)</h1>
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this course is to introduce you to software testing and
          debugging techniques that will improve and maintain the high quality
          of your software code. You will learn how to write testable code,
          define efficient and effective test cases, know when you have enough
          tests, automated techniques including unit and user-interface tests,
          and ways to test your code thoroughly using a minimum amount of
          effort. My goal is to ensure you get a good introduction to these
          areas, both in theory and by trying them and applying them to
          individual and group projects. The most important goal is your
          learning, and all the readings, exercises, and presentations are
          designed to help with that goal.

        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>
          The smallest piece of testable software can consist of only a few
          lines or a few hundred lines of code. This test is designed to make
          sure that this small amount of code satisfies its intended purpose and
          can be implemented correctly alongside the rest of the program.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Integration Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and interactions
          between integrated components or systems. Assumes the units being
          integrated are already well teted blocks, just being assembled
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>System/End to End Testing</h2>
        <p>
          System testing is testing the software within its intended hardware.
          These tests are done to ensure that the system behaves according to
          the intended requirements. Further bugs could appear when the software
          is implemented into a system thus system testing is used.
