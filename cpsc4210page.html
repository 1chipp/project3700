    <h1>CPSC 4210: Software Testing and Debugging: 5 credit class</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this course is to introduce you to software testing and
      debugging techniques that will improve and maintain the high quality of
      your software code. You will learn how to write testable code, define
      efficient and effective test cases, know when you have enough tests,
      automated techniques including unit and user-interface tests, and ways to
      test your code thoroughly using a minimum amount of effort. My goal is to
      ensure you get a good introduction to these areas, both in theory and by
      trying them and applying them to individual and group projects. The most
      important goal is your learning, and all the readings, exercises, and
      presentations are designed to help with that goal.
