      CPSC 4870/4880/4890: Software Engineering and Project Development (11
      Total Credits)
    </h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Principles of software engineering and their application in the planning
      and execution of a three-quarter-long software development project.
      Students work in teams to define and carry out software projects from
      initial requirements statements to final implementation. Activities
      include project planning and management, as well as analysis, design and
      implementation of the software project. In the fall quarter, projects are
      defined and requirement specifications are developed by the project teams.
      The required software products are then designed and implemented in the
      winter and spring quarters, culminating in a formal presentation of
      results at the end of the school year. For students pursuing a degree in
      computer science, the three courses, CPSC 4870, 4880, and 4890, must be
      taken as a continuous sequence and together, they fulfill the senior
      synthesis core requirement.
